  <sec:Introduction>
    <sec:Overview>
      An authentication server provides assertions to a relying party that a particular request for access is from an authentic digital identity associated with various identity attributes, such as a registered account within an information system, 
      or a certified identity as validated by a trusted certification authority or both. 
      The digital identities can represent people, devices or processes. Authentication servers validate various authenticators controlled by the entities represented by the presented digital identity. 
      When the entity is a person, authenticators can provide indications of what the entity knows (e.g., a password, pin or passphrase), what the entity has (e.g., a registered device in the control of the user), 
      or what the entity is (a biometric). NIST SP 800-63-3 Part B provides recommendations about how these authenticators can be leveraged individually or in combinations to 
      provide assurance that the entity is authentic and describes requirements for validation of the authenticators to various assurance levels. 
      A relying party may delegate verification of authenticator(s) to an authentication server; 
      such delegation creates a relationship between the relying party and the authentication server that is referred to as an identity federation. 
      Assertions to a federated relying party can be via bearer assertions or via direct communication with the relying party. 
      The latter mechanism is modeled after that used by Authentication, Access and Accounting (AAA) servers, which used the RADIUS protocol. 
      RADIUS has been largely replaced by DIAMETER, a protocol that addresses many of the security issues with RADIUS. 
      These provide direct, back-end assertions protected by an authenticated and encrypted channel to a Network Access Server that further governs accesses to resources on a network. 
      <h:p/>
      This PP-module describes the security functionality of authentication servers supporting RADIUS/DIAMETER and other messaging protocols intended for direct communications with relying parties via authenticated, real-time protected channels.
      <h:p/>
      The scope of this PP-Module is to describe the security functionality of an authentication server in terms of [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products. This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PP:

      <h:ul>
        <h:li>collaborative Protection Profile for
          Network Devices, Version 2.2e (NDcPP)</h:li>
      </h:ul>
      This Base-PP is valid because an authentication server can be deployed as a dedicated network appliance. 
      The use case of deploying the authentication server as an application on a general-purpose computer is outside the scope of this PP-Module. 
      Authentication server products allow enterprises to provide a centralized and standardized method of evaluating user authentication requests made throughout the enterprise. 
      This enables a centralized definition for user identity and credential data and allows for uniform application of authentication policies that define what credentials and user attributes are necessary to 
      gain access to various systems and applications in the enterprise environment. 
      <h:p/>
      Note that the NDcPP defines an optional architecture for a “distributed TOE” that allows for security functionality to be spread across multiple distinct components. 
      This PP-Module does not require or prohibit the TOE from being a distributed system when the TOE conforms to the NDcPP; the TOE may be standalone or distributed in this case.

    <sec:Compliant_Targets_of_Evaluation>
      This PP-Module specifically addresses a dedicated network device that performs entity (device or user) authentication via direct, back-end connections with a relying party. 
      The entity to be authenticated is referred to as the claimant, though different terms have been used for specific protocols (e.g., peer for RADIUS/DIAMETER). 
      The relying party can manage a single resource or provide access control for resources within a network. 
      For example, a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Access System may use the services of a dedicated authentication server during tunnel establishment. 
      In this use case, an authentication server must support IEEE 802.1X Port-Based Network Access Control and must fulfill the IEEE 802.11 authentication server role using Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) messaging. 
      <h:p/>
      Similarly, the authentication server may be used during Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnel establishment. 
      The relying party in this case is a VPN Gateway acting as a Network Access Server using passthrough between the VPN client and authentication server (the TOE), also using EAP messaging.
      <h:p/>
      In general, any relying party using a direct authentication federation protocol that supports EAP-TLS or EAP-TTLS messaging is addressed by this PP-Module.
      <h:p/>
      The combination of the NDcPP and this PP-Module is a network device that provides authentication server functionality in addition to all of the security functionality expected of a network device as mandated by the NDcPP. 
      <h:p/>
      This PP-Module describes the functional requirements and threats specific to authentication servers. A TOE that conforms to this PP-Module must also conform to the Base-PP.
    </sec:Compliant_Targets_of_Evaluation>
      <sec:TOE_Boundary>
        This document specifies SFRs for an authentication server. An authentication server is designed to authenticate a claimant that attempts to access a relying party – an access gateway to a protected network, 
        or individual resources and services – and provide assertions to one or more relying parties about the authentication state of the claimant. 
        A claimant forwards one or more authenticator outputs to the authentication server; the authentication server verifies the authenticator outputs and 
        may also provide additional identity attributes to allow the relying party to determine whether the claimant meets its authentication policy. 
        <h:p/>
        The authentication server defined by this PP-Module is one or more dedicated network appliances; the TOE is not intended to run as an application on a general-purpose computer. 
        The authentication server can be co-located with an access management or privilege management system, or it may be separate from such services. 
        Regardless of the deployment, access control functions and management of non-identity attributes are outside the scope of this PP-Module.
        <h:p/>
        An authentication server may be part of a larger system that also provides authorization information, 
        either as part of an AAA server, 
        an authorization server, or a domain controller. 
        This PP-Module specifies the functional requirements for authentication services only; as in the case where the TOE may be co-located with the relying party, 
        the TOE’s logical boundary only includes the authentication server functionality. 
        However, the TOE boundary includes the ability to generate audit events that are specific to the authentication functionality but may be used to support other functions (e.g., AAA servers).

    <sec:Use_Cases>
      This PP-Module defines potential use cases for the authentication server TOE, defined below. The first use case defines the physical embodiment of the TOE, while the latter three define its role in a network infrastructure.
      <usecases>
        <usecase id="usecase-dedicated" title="Dedicated Appliance">
          <description>The authentication server is integrated on a standalone network appliance. In this use case, conformance to the NDcPP and this PP-Module is sufficient to ensure security. 
            This PP-Module does not cover the use case where the authentication server is an application that is installed on a general-purpose computer.</description>
        </usecase>
        <usecase id="usecase-standalone" title="Standalone Server">
          <description>The system on which the authentication server is deployed is solely responsible for acting as an authenticator. 
            In this deployment, the authentication server’s only network infrastructure role is to communicate with the relying party for receiving challenges and issuing responses.</description>
        </usecase>
        <usecase id="usecase-colocated" title="Relying Party Co-Location">
          <description>
            The system on which the authentication server is deployed acts as both the relying party or its proxy and the authentication server. 
            In this deployment, the authentication server’s interactions with the relying party are internal-only. 
            Regardless of whether the relying party is a standalone component or the authentication server executable code also provides relying party functionality, 
            the TOE’s logical boundary still only includes the authentication server component. 
            Additionally, if the authentication server is a software application that can be deployed independently of the relying party, 
            the required external trusted communications must still be supported; 
            an authentication server cannot use the fact that it can be deployed on the same physical server as the relying party as a 
            way to exempt itself from implementation of IPsec, RadSec or mutually authenticated (D)TLS with an external relying party.
          </description>
        </usecase>
        <usecase id="usecase-integrated" title="Integrated as an Authorization Server Component">
          <description>
            The system on which the authentication server is deployed also acts as an authorization server 
            (e.g., as part of an AAA server) that provides authorization services in addition to the authentication server. 
            Assertions made via the direct connection can also include authorization information, and an unauthorized, but 
            authenticated user may result in a negative response to the relying party. 
            Regardless of whether these are all standalone components or whether the authentication server executable code also provides authorization functionality, 
            the TOE’s logical boundary still only includes the authentication server component. 
            As in the case where the authentication server is co-located with the relying party, 
            this deployment does not exempt the TOE from being able to implement all the functionality that this PP-Module requires.

  <sec:Security_Problem_Description>
    The security problem is described in terms of the threats that the TOE is expected to address, assumptions about its operational environment, and any organizational security policies that the TOE is expected to enforce.
    <sec:Threats>
      The following threats that are defined in this PP-Module extend the threats that are defined by the Base-PP.
      <threats>
        <threat name="T.FALSE_ENDPOINTS">
          <description>A malicious actor may falsely impersonate the TOE or a federated relying party in order to cause the TOE to operate in an insecure manner or 
            to extract security-relevant, or sensitive user data from the TOE or its Operational Environment.</description>
          <consistency-rationale>This threat is similar to the T.WEAK_AUTHENTICATION_ENDPOINTS threat in the NDcPP but it applies specifically to the NAS, 
            which is an environmental component that is defined specifically in this PP-Module.</consistency-rationale>
          <objective-refer ref="O.TRUSTED_RP">
            <rationale>The TOE’s enforcement of mutual authentication allows it and the relying party to identify and reject attempts for each component to be impersonated.

          </objective-refer>
        </threat>

        <threat name="T.INVALID_USERS">
          <description>A malicious user may supply incorrect or insufficient credential data or an otherwise invalid authentication request that is approved or ignored by the TSF such that protected resources are subject to unauthenticated access.
          </description>
          <consistency-rationale>This threat is similar to the T.UNAUTHORIZED_ADMINISTRATOR_ACCESS threat in the NDcPP but it applies to user authentication brokered by the TSF rather than to 
            administrator authentication to the TOE itself. It is also similar to the T.UNTRUSTED_COMMUNICATION_CHANNELS threat in the NDcPP except that it applies specifically to the 
            RADIUS communications and the protocols used to secure those, which is an interface that is defined specifically in this PP-Module.</consistency-rationale>
          <objective-refer ref="O.SECURITY_ASSOCIATION">
            <rationale>
              The TOE’s ability to maintain a security association ensures that a mechanism exists for the TSF to assert to an external entity that a given user is valid.

	      <h:p>
            This requirement covers the TOE's role as the authenticator in an 802.1X
            authentication exchange. If the exchange is completed successfully, the TOE will obtain the PMK from
            the RADIUS server and perform the four-way handshake with the wireless client (supplicant) to begin
            802.11 communications.</h:p>
	    <h:p>
            As indicated previously, there are at least three communication paths present during the exchange; two
            with the TOE as an endpoint and one with the TOE acting as a transfer point only.
	    The TOE establishes an EAP over Local Area Network (EAPOL) connection with the wireless
	    client as specified in 802.1X-2007.
	    The TOE also establishes (or has established) a RADIUS protocol connection protected either
	    by IPsec or RadSec (TLS) with the RADIUS server. 
            The wireless client and RADIUS server establish an EAP-TLS session
            (RFC 5216); in this transaction the TOE merely takes the EAP-TLS packets from its EAPOL/RADIUS
            endpoint and transfers them to the other endpoint. Because the specific authentication method (TLS in
            this case) is opaque to the TOE, there are no requirements with respect to RFC 5126 in this PP-Module.
            However, the base RADIUS protocol (2865) has an update (3579) that will need to be addressed in the
            implementation and evaluation activities. Additionally, RFC 5080 contains implementation issues that
            will need to be addressed by developers but which levy no new requirements.</h:p>
	    <h:p>
            
            The point of performing 802.1X authentication is to provide access to the network (assuming the
            authentication was successful and that all 802.11 negotiations are performed successfully); in the
            terminology of 802.1X, this means the wireless client has access to the "controlled port" maintained by
            the TOE.

            <aactivity>
              <TSS>
                In order to show that the TSF implements the 802.1X-2010 standard correctly, the evaluator will ensure
                that the TSS contains the following information: <h:ul>
                <h:li>The sections (clauses) of the standard that the TOE implements</h:li>
                <h:li>For each identified section, any options selected in the implementation allowed by the
                standards are specified</h:li>
                <h:li>For each identified section, any non-conformance is identified and described, including a
                justification for the non-conformance</h:li>
                </h:ul>
                Because the connection to the RADIUS server will be contained in an IPsec or RadSec (TLS) tunnel,
                the security mechanisms detailed in the RFCs identified in the requirement are not relied on to provide
                protection for these communications. Consequently, no extensive analysis of the RFCs is required.
                However, the evaluator will ensure that the TSS describes the measures (documentation, testing) that
                are taken by the product developer to ensure that the TOE conforms to the RFCs listed in this
                requirement.<h:br/><h:br/>

                  <test>The evaluator will demonstrate that a wireless client has no access to the test network. After
                    successfully authenticating with a RADIUS server through the TOE, the evaluator will demonstrate that

                  <test>The evaluator will demonstrate that a wireless client has no access to the test network. The
                    evaluator will attempt to authenticate using an invalid client certificate, such that the EAP-TLS
                    negotiation fails. This should result in the wireless client still being unable to access the test network.

                <h:b>Note: </h:b>Tests 2 and 3 above are not tests that "EAP-TLS works," although that is a by-product of the test.
                The test is actually that a failed authentication (under two failure modes) results in denial of access to
                the network, which demonstrates the enforcement of FIA_8021X_EXT.1.3.

              When the TSF negotiates a TLS_RSA_PSK cipher suite, the TSF shall verify that the presented identifier matches the reference identifier per RFC 6125 section 6.
            </title>
            <note role="application">
	      <h:p>
	      This requirement must be claimed if any ciphersuites beginning with 'TLS_RSA_PSK' are selected in FCS_RADSEC_EXT.2.1.</h:p>
	      <h:p>
              The rules for verification of identity are described in Section 6 of RFC 6125. 
              The reference identifier is typically established by configuration (e.g. configuring the name of the authentication server). 
              Based on a singular reference identifier’s source domain and application service type (e.g. HTTP, SIP, LDAP), 
              the client establishes all reference identifiers which are acceptable, such as a Common Name for the Subject Name field of the certificate and a (case-insensitive) DNS name for the Subject Alternative Name field. 
              The client then compares this list of all acceptable reference identifiers to the presented identifiers in the TLS server’s certificate.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
              The preferred method for verification is the Subject Alternative Name using DNS names, URI names, or Service Names. 
              Verification using the Common Name is required for the purposes of backwards compatibility. 
              Additionally, support for use of IP addresses in the Subject Name or Subject Alternative name is discouraged as against best practices but may be implemented. 
              Finally, support for wildcards is discouraged but may be implemented. 
              If the client supports wildcards, the client must follow the best practices regarding matching; these best practices are captured in the evaluation activity.

		This requirement must be included if IPsec or another protocol that uses pre-shared keys is claimed, and pre-shared key authentication is selected 
          (e.g., "Pre-shared Keys" is selected in FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.13 or "pre-shared keys" is selected in FCS_RADSEC_EXT.1.2). 
          The intent of this requirement is that all protocols will support both text-based and bit-based pre-shared keys.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
		For the length of the text-based pre-shared keys, a common length (22 characters) is required to help
		promote interoperability.
		If other lengths are supported, they should be listed in the assignment;
		this assignment can also specify a range of values (e.g., "lengths from 5 to 55 characters") as well.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
		For <xref to="fel-get-psk"/>, the ST author specifies whether the TSF merely accepts bit-based pre-shared keys
		or is capable of generating them.
		If it generates them, the requirement specifies that they must be
		generated using the RBG provided by the TOE.

	    <TSS>
	      The evaluator will verify that the TSS describes 
	      <h:ol>
		<h:li>the protocols that can use pre-shared keys and that these are consistent with the selections made in <xref to="fel-use-psk"/>.</h:li>
		<h:li>the allowable values for pre-shared keys and that they are consistent with the selections made in <xref to="fel-valid-psk"/>.</h:li>

              <Guidance>
		  The evaluator will examine the operational guidance to determine that it provides guidance to
                administrators on the composition of strong text-based pre-shared keys, and (if the selection indicates
                keys of various lengths can be entered) that it provides information on the range of lengths supported.
                The guidance must specify the allowable characters for pre-shared keys, and that list must be a superset of the list contained in FIA_PSK_EXT.1.2.<h:br/><h:br/>
                The evaluator will confirm the operational guidance contains instructions for either entering bit-based
                pre-shared keys for each protocol identified in the requirement or for generating a bit-based pre-shared
                key (or both).<h:br/><h:br/>
	      </Guidance>
              <Tests>The evaluator will also perform the following tests for each protocol (or instantiation of a protocol, if
                performed by a different implementation on the TOE). Note that one or more of these tests can be
                performed with a single test case.
                <testlist>
                  <test>The evaluator will compose a pre-shared key of 22 characters that contains a combination of
                    the allowed characters in accordance with the operational guidance and demonstrates that a successful
                    protocol negotiation can be performed with the key.
                  </test>
                  <test>[conditional]: If the TOE supports pre-shared keys of multiple lengths, the evaluator will repeat
                    Test 1 using the minimum length; the maximum length; a length inside the allowable range; and invalid
                    lengths beyond the supported range (both higher and lower). The minimum, maximum, and included
                    length tests should be successful, and the invalid lengths must be rejected by the TOE.
                  </test>
                  <test>[conditional]: If the TOE does not generate bit-based pre-shared keys, the evaluator will obtain a
                    bit-based pre-shared key of the appropriate length and enter it according to the instructions in the
                    operational guidance. The evaluator will then demonstrate that a successful protocol negotiation can
                    be performed with the key.</test>
                  <test>[conditional]: If the TOE does generate bit-based pre-shared keys, the evaluator will generate a
                    bit-based pre-shared key of the appropriate length and use it according to the instructions in the
                    operational guidance. The evaluator will then demonstrate that a successful protocol negotiation can
                    be performed with the key.

    This PP-Module has no implicitly satisfied requirements. All SFR dependencies are explicitly met either through SFRs defined by the PP-Module or inherited from the Base-PP.

  <appendix title="Allocation of Requirements in Distributed TOEs" id="allocation">
    
    For a distributed TOE, the security functional requirements in this PP-Module need to be met by the
    TOE as a whole, but not all SFRs will necessarily be implemented by all components. The
    following categories are defined in order to specify when each SFR must be implemented by a
    component: <h:ul>
      <h:li><h:b>All Components ("All")</h:b> &#8212;All components that comprise the distributed TOE must
        independently satisfy the requirement.</h:li>
      <h:li><h:b>At least one Component ("One")</h:b> &#8212;This requirement must be fulfilled by at least one
        component within the distributed TOE.</h:li>
      <h:li><h:b>Feature Dependent ("Feature Dependent")</h:b> &#8212; These requirements will only be
        fulfilled where the feature is implemented by the distributed TOE component (note
        that the requirement to meet the PP-Module as a whole requires that at least one component
        implements these requirements if they are claimed by the TOE).</h:li></h:ul>
    The table below specifies how each of the SFRs in this PP-Module must be met, using the categories above.
